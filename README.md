One of few ways how to run my project:
1. open the link I sent in email ( https://github.com/suvic/brilo.git )
2. there you click on green button saying 'Code' and click on the icon of two boxes hovering over self next to the link. it should copy the link
3. assuming you have opened Visual Studio Code you open terminal with following command: Ctrl + Shift + ; 
4. on macs you have to open terminal by clicking on the top part on Terminal and click on New Terminal
4. you click inside terminal and type: git clone (paste the link you copied)
5. press enter and wait until the download is done
6. after the download you open folder with the project you just downloaded by clicking on top part of VS Code - File and Open Folder. there you find and chose the folder called brilo
7. open terminal the same way as before and type: npm ci
8. after download you type: npm run watch
9. it should open new browser tab with the project, if not hold Ctrl/command and click on the link in terminal
